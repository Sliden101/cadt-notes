# Defintion
Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics aimed at solving systems of linear equations with a Ô¨Ånite number of unknowns. In particular, one would like to obtain answers to the following questions:

- **Characterization of solutions**: Are there solutions to a given system of linear equations? How many solutions are there?
- **Finding solutions:** How does the solution set look? What are the solutions?

Sets of all numbers:

$$\begin{aligned}\mathbb{N}={\{1,2,3,4,...\}}\\\mathbb{N}=\{x|\text{ x is an integer}\}\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}\mathbb{Z}={\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}}\\\mathbb{Z}=\{x|\text{ x is an integer}\}\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{Q}=\{x| \text{ x is a rational number}\} \\ \mathbb{Q}=\{x|x=\frac{p}{q};p,q\in\mathbb{Z};q\neq0\}
\end{aligned}$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{R}=\{x| x=a+bi; b<0\} \\ \mathbb{R}=\{x| \text{ x is a real number}\}
\end{aligned}$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{C}=\{x| \text{x is a complex number}\} \\ \mathbb{C}=\{x| a,b\in\mathbb{R},i=\sqrt{-1}\}
\end{aligned}$$
