# Diophantine equation

Diophantine Equation (LDE): is a polynomial equation with 2 or more integer unknowns.

Linear Diophantine Equation (LDE): is an equation with 2 or more integer unknowns and the integer unknowns are each to at most degree of 1.

Linear Diophantine equation in two variables takes the form of $ax+by=c$, where $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a,b,c$ are integer constants. x and y are unknown variables.

A **Homogeneous** Linear Diophantine equation in two variables takes the form of $ax+by=0$, $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a,b,c$. Note that x = 0 and y = 0 is a solution, called the trivial solution for this equation.


## Examples

Example of homogeneous linear diophantine equation

$$5x-3y=0, x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$$
In this case $x=3$ and $y=5$ is a solution as is $x=6$ and $y=10$.
Hence $x=3k$ and $y=5k, k\in\mathbb{Z}$ represents all the solutions.
